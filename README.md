# Microservice Practice Application with SignalR, RabbitMQ, Redis, and Angular

![Microservice Practice](microservice-practice.png)

Welcome to the Microservice Practice Application repository! I have developed a microservices circle using SignalR, RabbitMQ, Redis, and Angular. Learn how to implement microservices with real-time updates and efficient communication. For now I did not added any  authintication and authorization in the code. But in future I will add JWT token based authintication and authorization. I have also used mongoDB and repository pattern in this application. 

Additionally, I have also used docker to install mongdb, Redis and RabbitMQ. This just my first microservice demo project.

## Introduction

Explore microservices using SignalR, RabbitMQ, Redis, and Angular. Gain hands-on experience with real-time communication, asynchronous messaging, and efficient caching. 

## Technologies Used

- **SignalR**: Implement real-time communication between microservices. Though I have some previous experience with TCP and UDP application in c# but this is my first web socket based application.
- **RabbitMQ**: Enable asynchronous communication through message queues. To enable microservice facility I have used this messaging bus.
- **Redis**: Optimize data retrieval and performance with in-memory caching. TThis is my first redis based application and I am very new to this technology
- **Angular**: Build interactive and responsive user interfaces. However, in this project I just use it to use signalr library and I have a prior knowledge about angular

## Features

- Real-time updates and notifications using SignalR.
- Asynchronous communication between microservices through RabbitMQ.
- Efficient caching and data storage with Redis.
- Interactive and responsive user interfaces developed with Angular.
- Scalable and maintainable microservice architecture.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have:

- Node.js and npm (for Angular)
- RabbitMQ server
- Redis server
